## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend/API: Node.js and Express(JavaScript)
Database: SQL (PostgreSQL)
Payments: Stripe or Square

##Automatic Testing
Frontend unit testing (Jest / React Testing Library)
Backend API testing (JUnit or equivalent)
Basic integration testing
Define who maintains test coverage and when tests must pass (before merge)
Role Assignments (Updated)
Brianna – Frontend & QA
Carlos – QA & Flex
Evan – Backend
Alec – Backend & Flex
Jake – Frontend & Flex
Proposed Workload Distribution
##Frontend
Brianna + Jake
UI components
Forms (Members, Appointments, Check-ins)
API integration
Frontend validation
Frontend unit tests
Jake flexes to backend support if frontend load is lighter.
##Backend
Evan + Alec
Database models
API routes
Business logic
Authentication (if included)
Backend unit tests
Deployment configuration
Alec flexes to frontend if backend work slows down.
##QA / Testing Ownership
Brianna + Carlos
Create test cases
Manual feature validation
Ensure test coverage stays consistent
Run regression testing before demos
Verify bug fixes
Carlos helps where needed (frontend or backend) after QA tasks are complete.
How the Workload Flows
Each feature is built backend first → then frontend integration → then QA validation
No feature is considered “done” unless:
Code works
Tests pass
QA verifies it
Flex members help where bottlenecks appear
Everyone pushes through GitHub using branches + pull requests
##Why This Works
Clear backend ownership (Evan/Alec)
Clear frontend ownership (Brianna/Jake)
Dedicated QA (Brianna/Carlos)
Two flex roles prevent bottlenecks
Automatic testing ensures fewer demo-day surprises
